## FuniFi CiiVii
# Analog synth CV&Gate controller
V0.1

Funifi CiiVii is shines with semimodular synths or small Eurorack kits, where extra CV or Gate control is welcome without expensive or large external devices. One CV output 0-5V and one gate output can be programmed to do whatever you want them to do. Just randomising the analog voltage seem to give hours of fun when plugged to various inputs in the analog synthesiser.

# How to get it

There will be DIY kits available when next round of testing has cleared some concerns. The circuit can be build on breadboard very easily for the hasty & geeky ones. If you would be interested in beta testing either the soldering, or coding, or both, don't hesitate to contact, few test kits will be avilable shortly.

# Open hardware

Funifi is all open source hardware and open source software, with all four freedoms, basically, do whatever you like with them, as long as you share your derivatives under same freedom.
